abstract="This paper develops techniques for efficiently detecting redundancies in CNF formulas. We introduce the concept of hidden literals, resulting in the novel technique of hidden literal elimination. We develop a practical simplification algorithm that enables ``Unhiding'' various redundancies in a unified framework. Based on time stamping literals in the binary implication graph, the algorithm applies various binary clause based simplifications, including techniques that, when run repeatedly until fixpoint, can be too costly. Unhiding can also be applied during search, taking learnt clauses into account. We show that Unhiding gives performance improvements on real-world SAT competition benchmarks.",

abstract="Stochastic Local Search (SLS) solvers are considered one of the best solving technique for randomly generated problems and more recently also have shown great promise for several types of hard combinatorial problems. Within this work, we provide a thorough analysis of different implementation variants of SLS solvers on random and on hard combinatorial problems. By analyzing existing SLS implementations, we are able to discover new improvements inspired by CDCL solvers, which can speed up the search of all types of SLS solvers. Further, our analysis reveals that the multilevel break values of variables can be easily computed and used within the decision heuristic. By augmenting the probSAT solver with the new heuristic, we are able to reach new state-of-the-art performance on several types of SAT problems, especially on those with long clauses. We further provide a detailed analysis of the clause selection policy used in focused search SLS solvers.",

We demonstrate that CB improves the performance of the winner of the latest SAT Competition, Maple{\_}LCM{\_}Dist, and the winner of the latest MaxSAT Evaluation Open-WBO.",

abstract="We present a novel preprocessing technique to automatically reduce the size of Boolean formulas. This technique, called Bounded Variable Addition (BVA), exchanges clauses for variables. Similar to other preprocessing techniques, BVA greedily lowers the sum of variables and clauses, a rough measure for the hardness to solve a formula. We show that cardinality constraints (CCs) can efficiently be reencoded: from a naive CC encoding, BVA automatically generates a compact encoding, which is smaller than sophisticated encodings. Experimental results show that applying BVA can improve SAT solving performance.",

We discuss critical implementation details that make the reduction procedure fast enough to be practical.",
