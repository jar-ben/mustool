1) You will need:
* MySQL server
* MySQL libraries
* PHP5
* Apache
* Chrome or Firefox, but prefer chrome, js is faster there

2) create "cryptoms database" in mysql:

$ mysql -u root -p PASS
$ create database cryptoms

3) create two MySQL users:
* one "cryptomsuser" , with empty password, which can read-write to database "cryptoms"
* one "presenter", with empty password, which can read database "cryptoms"

4) run:

$ mysql -u cryptomsuser cryptoms < web/tablestructure.sql

this will create the table structures needed

4) compile and exectute cryptoms as:

$ ./cryptominisat --sql 1 MYFILE.cnf

and let it run for at least 20'000 conflicts. It should run without any problems.
If there is any problem with MySQL, it will print the exact error, errors are not
silently ignored.

5) you can now play around with the data in mysql:

$ mysql -u cryptomsuser cryptoms
$ show tables;
$ select * from restartDB;

3) Copy everything under "web" into /var/www/cryptoms and make sure that it's
readable by apache.

4) point your browser to

http://localhost/cryptoms

you should see the output of the last run. You can also refresh it, and if it's
running in the background, you will see the graphs update. Note that if your
last solving run was aborted early,and there was no data input into MySQL
then there will be no data shown. So make sure your last run of cryptominisat
with option "--sql 1" was meaningful, i.e. long enough.
