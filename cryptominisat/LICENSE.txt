The general priciple of the licensing is as follows. Everything that's
needed to run/build/install/link the system is MIT licensed. This allows
easy distribution and running of the system everywhere. Files that
have no copyright header are also MIT licensed. Note that in case you
compile with M4RI, then M4RI's GPL license affects the final executable
and library.

Everything else that's not needed to run/build/install/link is usually GPLv2
licensed or compatible (see the copyright headers.) The only exceptions are the
following files in docs/:
* `splncs03.bat` which is under the LPPL
* `ieee.cls` which is covered by the IEEE Copyright Policy
